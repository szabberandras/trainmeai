  - Advanced planning services integration
  - Sport focus determination
  - Experience-to-difficulty mapping
  - All exercise generation methods

### **3. Exercise Interface Fragmentation - FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Before**: 4+ different Exercise interfaces with conflicting properties
- **After**: Single unified `Exercise` interface in `lib/types/core.ts`
- **Unique Features Preserved**:
  - Core Identity (id, name, category, subcategory)
  - Training Parameters (sets, reps, duration, weight, restTime)
  - Exercise Details (equipment, muscles, difficulty)
  - Instructions & Media (instructions, tips, modifications, videos)
  - Backward compatibility aliases (targetMuscles ‚Üí primaryMuscles)

### **4. Swimming Workouts Scattered - FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Before**: 4 separate files with likely duplicates
  - `swimming-workouts-additional.ts`
  - `swimming-workouts-batch2.ts`
  - `swimming-workouts-batch3.ts`
  - `swimming-workouts-converted.ts`
- **After**: Single consolidated file `swimming-workouts-consolidated.ts`
- **Features Added**:
  - Unified workout collection with ALL unique workouts preserved
  - Categorization by training focus (endurance, cardio, speed, technique, test)
  - Difficulty-based organization (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - `SwimmingWorkoutService` class with utility methods
  - Workout recommendation system based on user profile
  - Search functionality
  - Backward compatibility exports

### **5. TrainingPlan Interface Fragmentation - FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Before**: 3 different TrainingPlan interfaces with unique features
- **After**: Single unified `TrainingPlan` interface preserving ALL functionality
- **Unique Features Preserved**:
  - Simple training plans (name, type, weeks)
  - Enhanced AI plans (persona, energy systems, periodization)
  - Professional plans (training zones, prerequisites, weekly schedules)
  - Metadata and tracking (createdAt, updatedAt, notes)

## üîß **CORE TYPES SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**

### **lib/types/core.ts - Single Source of Truth**
- **Unified UserProfile**: Combines 8 different definitions
- **Unified Exercise**: Combines 4+ different definitions  
- **Unified TrainingPlan**: Combines 3 different definitions
- **Backward Compatibility Types**: Ensures existing code continues working
- **Utility Functions**: Convert between different profile formats
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Guide developers to new unified types

### **Conversion Utilities**
```typescript
// Convert unified profile to specific formats
toTrainingUserProfile(profile: UserProfile): TrainingUserProfile
toAuthUserProfile(profile: UserProfile): AuthUserProfile
toTrainingGenerationUserProfile(profile: UserProfile): TrainingGenerationUserProfile
```

## üìä **CONSOLIDATION STATISTICS**

### **Files Consolidated**
- ‚úÖ **TrainingService.ts** ‚Üí Merged into `training.service.ts`
