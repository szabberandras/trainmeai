# Cinematic Onboarding Experience

## Overview

The new onboarding experience is designed as **"The Opening Scene"** - a cinematic, full-screen experience that feels like a premium wellness app. It combines ambient backgrounds, story-driven flow, and minimal UI elements to create an emotional connection before showing any interface.

## Design Philosophy

### ðŸŽ¬ **Cinematic "Opening Scene"**
- Full-screen experience with ambient background animations

### ðŸŒ… **Mood & Feel**
- Ambient background with soft motion gradients and floating elements
- Dark gradient backgrounds (slate-900 via blue-900 to indigo-900)
