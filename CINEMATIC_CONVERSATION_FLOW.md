# MyPace AI Conversation Flow Implementation

## Overview

The AI chat experience now embodies the **MyPace** philosophy - going at the user's own pace with thoughtful, cinematic conversations that build genuine connections rather than rushing to generate programs.

## Key Changes Made

### üé¨ **System Prompt Redesign**
**File**: `app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Before**: Efficient, comprehensive data collection with multi-part questions
**After**: MyPace approach - one question at a time as foundation with strategic comprehensive gathering when natural

```typescript
MYPACE PHILOSOPHY:
- This is about understanding the person at THEIR pace, not rushing to results
- Ask ONE focused question at a time as the foundation
- Always acknowledge and provide positive feedback before asking the next question
- Build emotional connection through encouragement and understanding
- Strategically weave in comprehensive data collection when it flows naturally
```

### üó£Ô∏è **Conversation Flow Style**

**1. ACKNOWLEDGE & ENCOURAGE (Always First):**
- "That's wonderful that you want to..."
- "I love that you're focusing on..."
- "Great choice! [Activity] is excellent for..."

**2. ONE QUESTION AT A TIME (Foundation):**
- "What does [their goal] look like in your daily life?"
- "How are you feeling about [specific aspect] right now?"
- "What's been your experience with [activity] so far?"

**3. STRATEGIC COMPREHENSIVE GATHERING (When Natural):**
Only when conversation flows naturally:
"Since we're building your [goal], I'm curious about a few things that will help me design the perfect program: [2-3 related questions that flow from their previous answer]"

### üì± **Activity Templates Updated**
**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before**: Multiple comprehensive questions upfront
**After**: Single thoughtful question that builds emotional connection

**Example - Strength Training:**
```
"That's fantastic! Strength training is one of the best investments you can make in your health and confidence. There's something truly empowering about knowing your body can handle whatever life throws at you.

What draws you to strength training specifically? Is it about feeling stronger in your daily activities, building muscle, or perhaps something deeper like confidence?"
```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Cross-Training Integration**
Enhanced awareness for marathon training:
- Naturally weaves in strength training for injury prevention
- Considers cross-training options for recovery
- Addresses flexibility/mobility work
- Example: "For marathon training, we'll want to include some strength work to keep you injury-free and running strong. Do you have gym access for that, or would you prefer bodyweight options?"

## MyPace Conversation Example

**User:** "I want to start strength training"

**AI:** "That's fantastic! Strength training is one of the best investments you can make in your health and confidence. There's something truly empowering about knowing your body can handle whatever life throws at you.

What draws you to strength training specifically? Is it about feeling stronger in your daily activities, building muscle, or perhaps something deeper like confidence?"

**User:** "I want to feel more confident"

**AI:** "I absolutely love that goal - confidence is such a powerful outcome of strength training. There's something special about knowing your body can handle whatever life throws at you.

Since we're building your confidence through strength, I'm curious about a few things that will help me design the perfect program: Have you done any lifting before, and how many days per week could you realistically commit? Also, do you have access to a gym or are you thinking more home-based?"

**User:** "I'm new to lifting, can do 3 days a week, have a gym membership"

**AI:** "Perfect! Starting fresh with 3 days a week and gym access gives us so many great options to build that confidence systematically.

What feels most important to you as we begin - learning proper form so you feel safe and confident, or starting with exercises that feel comfortable and achievable?"

## Information Gathering Sequence

1. **Understand deeper motivation and emotional connection**
2. **Assess current experience and comfort level** (weave in naturally)
3. **Learn about specific situation and constraints** (when conversation flows there)
4. **Understand preferences and concerns**
5. **Clarify vision of success**
6. **Confirm commitment and readiness**

## Ready to Generate

After **4-6 meaningful exchanges**, when you truly understand their situation, goals, and preferences:

"Based on our conversation, I have a clear picture of what you're looking for. Let me summarize what I understand:

[Detailed summary of their goals, situation, preferences, and any concerns]

Does this capture everything accurately? If so, I'm excited to create a personalized program that addresses all of these aspects and helps you [specific benefit]. Would you like me to design your MyPace program now?"
